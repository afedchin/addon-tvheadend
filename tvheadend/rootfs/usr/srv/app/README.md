# tvhProxy

A small flask app to proxy requests between Plex Media Server and Tvheadend. This repo adds a few critical improvements and fixes to the archived upstream version at [jkaberg/tvhProxy](https://github.com/jkaberg/tvhProxy):

- [SSDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol) Discovery. Fixes the issue of Plex randomly dropping the device.
- [XMLTV EPG](https://support.plex.tv/articles/using-an-xmltv-guide/) EPG export, including adding dummy programme entries for channels without EPG so you can still use these channels in Plex (see below for Plex configuration URL)
- Configuration of variables via [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) file

#### tvhProxy configuration

1. Check tvhProxy.py for configuration options and set them up them as `KEY=VALUE` pairs in a `.env` file.
2. Create a virtual enviroment: `$ python3 -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the virtual enviroment: `$ . .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the requirements: `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Finally run the app with: `$ python tvhProxy.py`

#### systemd service configuration

A startup script for Ubuntu can be found in tvhProxy.service (change paths and user in tvhProxy.service to your setup), install with:

    $ sudo cp tvhProxy.service /etc/systemd/system/tvhProxy.service
    $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    $ sudo systemctl enable tvhProxy.service
    $ sudo systemctl start tvhProxy.service

#### Plex configuration

Enter the IP of the host running tvhProxy including port 5004, eg.: `192.168.1.50:5004`, use `http://192.168.1.50:5004/epg.xml` for the EPG (see [Using XMLTV for guide data](https://support.plex.tv/articles/using-an-xmltv-guide/) for full instructions).

Should the proxy keep disappearing or you can't add it, it's worth trying to delete the existing configuration from the database:

- See https://support.plex.tv/articles/201100678-repair-a-corrupt-database/ on how to access the plex config database and
- run `delete from media_provider_resources;` to remove any leftover config.
